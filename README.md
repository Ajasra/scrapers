# scrapers

## About

scrapers is a collection of free/libre open-source software written by [Aar√≥n Montoya-Moraga](http://montoyamoraga.io/).

scrapers is both a tool for building databases and and educational resource for learning scraping.

scrapers is educational because it tries to be heavily documented, clean, and easy to follow.

scrapers performs the scraping in an explicit way, it shows you the browser going through the data, instead of running in the background, thus being very open in the way it works, which can be used for both documentation and live performance.

## Technical details

All of these scrapers were written using [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Selenium](https://www.seleniumhq.org/), and [ChromeDriver](http://chromedriver.chromium.org/).
